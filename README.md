# Project purpose
## Learning Outcomes
Taken from Assessment Handbook provided by Code Institute.
- Implement a given algorithm as a computer program ([Study.com](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-an-algorithm-in-programming-definition-examples-analysis.html))
- Adapt and combine algorithms to solve a given problem
- Adequately use standard programming constructs: repitition, selection, functions, composition, modules, aggregated data (arrays, lists, etc.)
- Explain what given program does
- Indentify and repair coding errors in program
- Use library software for building a garphical user interface, or command-line interface, or web application, or mathematical softaware
- implement a data model, application features and business logic to manage, query and manipulate data to meet given needs in a particular real-world domain
- Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub
- Deploy a command-line application to a cloud-based platform ([Buil a Bear]())<----- don't forget to put in link

### Media
- For how to make the nav-bar https://github.com/artkonekt/menu/blob/master/README.md was used.
- As template for README https://github.com/mikakallberg/readme-template/blob/master/README.md was used
- Also fellow student Mats Simonsson README from his Project Portfolio 3 [Pelikantapeten](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten/p3-dad-jokes/blob/main/README.md) was used as inspiration.
